## Architecture

### Frontend Components

#### PaymentHandler.tsx
The main payment component that handles:
- UPI payment initiation
- Error handling and display
- Payment verification
- Retry logic
- User interface states

#### BookingForm.tsx
Integrates with PaymentHandler to:
- Create bookings in the database
- Handle payment success/failure
- Update booking status

### Backend Services

#### Convex Functions (bookings.ts)
- `create`: Creates new bookings
- `verifyPayment`: Verifies payment status
- `retryPayment`: Handles payment retries
- `getPaymentStatus`: Retrieves payment status
- `updatePaymentStatus`: Updates payment status

#### Payment Utilities (lib/payment-utils.ts)
- UPI ID validation
- Payment amount validation
- UPI deep link generation
- Error handling utilities
- Currency formatting
- Transaction reference generation

## Payment Flow

### 1. Booking Creation
```
User fills booking form ‚Üí Booking created in database ‚Üí Payment handler displayed
```

### 2. Payment Initiation
```
Validate UPI ID ‚Üí Generate UPI deep link ‚Üí Open UPI app ‚Üí Start verification process
```

### 3. Payment Verification
```
Automatic verification attempts ‚Üí Manual verification fallback ‚Üí Update booking status
```

### 4. Error Handling
```
Detect error type ‚Üí Display appropriate message ‚Üí Provide retry options ‚Üí Update status
```

## Error Types and Handling

### Bank Limit Error
- **Cause**: User exceeds their bank's UPI transaction limit
- **Solution**: Offer split payment option or suggest smaller amounts
- **User Action**: Try with smaller amount or use different payment method

### Network Error
- **Cause**: Internet connectivity issues or payment gateway problems
- **Solution**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **User Action**: Check internet connection and retry

### Invalid UPI ID
- **Cause**: Incorrect UPI ID format
- **Solution**: Real-time validation with helpful format guidance
- **User Action**: Enter valid UPI ID format (e.g., name@bank)

### Payment Timeout
- **Cause**: Payment verification takes too long
- **Solution**: Manual verification option
- **User Action**: Check UPI app and confirm payment manually

### Insufficient Balance
- **Cause**: User's account has insufficient funds
- **Solution**: Clear error message with balance check suggestion
- **User Action**: Add money to account or use different payment method

## Configuration

### UPI Settings
```typescript
const UPI_CONFIG = {
  defaultUpiId: "tanvishdesai.05@oksbi",
  merchantCode: "5411", // Entertainment category
  currency: "INR",
  maxAmount: 100000,
  minAmount: 1
};
```

### Retry Configuration
```typescript
const RETRY_CONFIG = {
  maxRetries: 3,
  baseDelay: 1000,
  maxDelay: 30000,
  verificationTimeout: 300000 // 5 minutes
};
```

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Data Encryption
- All payment data encrypted in transit
- Sensitive data not logged
- Secure UPI deep link generation

### 2. Input Validation
- UPI ID format validation
- Payment amount limits
- Transaction reference validation

### 3. Error Handling
- No sensitive data in error messages
- Secure error logging
- User-friendly error descriptions

### 4. Session Management
- Secure booking session handling
- Payment status tracking
- Timeout management

## Testing

### Manual Testing Scenarios
1. **Successful Payment**: Complete payment flow with valid UPI ID
2. **Bank Limit Error**: Test with amount exceeding bank limits
3. **Network Error**: Simulate network connectivity issues
4. **Invalid UPI ID**: Test with malformed UPI IDs
5. **Payment Timeout**: Test verification timeout scenarios
6. **Retry Logic**: Test automatic and manual retry mechanisms

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run payment system tests
npm test payment-system

# Run specific error scenarios
npm test payment-errors

# Run security tests
npm test payment-security
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Payment Metrics
- Success rate tracking
- Error type distribution
- Average payment time
- Retry attempt statistics

### Error Logging
- Structured error logging
- Payment attempt tracking
- User journey mapping
- Performance monitoring
